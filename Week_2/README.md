# BCB 546X -- Week 2

## 17 Jan -- Remote Machines & Intro to Version Control using Git

You can find the slides in the file called `lecture_17Jan-TAH.html`. This presentation was written in Markdown using [remark](https://remarkjs.com/#1) which creates a HTML slideshow. You should be able to open the lecture file in your  web browser. As long as the `.html` file is in the same directory as the `images` directory and you are connected to the internet, you should be able to see the whole slide show.

## 19 January -- More Fun with Git

The lecture notes are in the file called `lecture_19Jan-TAH.html`.

Another **BAD** edit by tracy. Because merge conflicts are fun.
